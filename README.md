# Biodiversity Analytics Project

## Overview
This project analyzes biodiversity data to extract insights about various species and their conservation status. The analysis is performed using Python and presented through both a Jupyter notebook and an interactive dashboard.

## Project Structure
- biodiversity.ipynb - Jupyter notebook containing the main data analysis
- dashboard.py - Interactive dashboard for visualizing biodiversity data
- observations.csv - Dataset containing species observations
- species_info.csv - Dataset containing species information
- style.css - Styling for the dashboard

## Data Description
This project uses two main datasets:
- **Species Information**: Contains data about different species and their characteristics
- **Observations**: Records of species observations across different locations and time periods

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`):
  - pandas
  - matplotlib

  - plotly (for dashboard)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Install required dependencies
3. Open the Jupyter notebook or run the dashboard

## Usage

### Jupyter Notebook Analysis
```bash
jupyter notebook biodiversity.ipynb
```

### Interactive Dashboard
